                            The WeightTracker helps you keep track of your weight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It presents an intuitive interface which allows everyone to feel at home right from the start.
                            The modern design and simple structure makes the app suitable for almost everyone.
                            The WeightTracker is usable on all kind of devices, be they phones, tablets or desktops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Running your own WeightTracker instance could also not be easier:
                            The application has been built using <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Docker</a>,
                            which makes deploying it to any kind of host machine very easy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tool stores all your data using just three entities, as seen here:
                            <img th:src="@{public/Datenbank.png}" alt="database layout" class="img-fluid" />
                            The center of the WeightTracker is the <em>WeightEntry</em>, which stores the weight
                            of a single person on a specific day. There can be many such entities for each user,
                            although each user may only have one for a specific day.
                            Also, users have the ability to attach images to their weight entries.
                            This allows one to visually see their progress over time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The WeightTracker consists of the following features:

                                <li>
                                    Users can edit and delete any of their saved weights.

                            Weights are presented to the user in a chronological order, using a line chart.
                            Clicking on the data points of the chart allows the user to edit the corresponding weight entry.
